I am Jingyi Su, currently a software engineer at Google. 

“Careers are a jungle gym, not a ladder.” ― Sheryl Sandberg. Over the past decade, I have honed my skills and grown through diverse technical and leadership roles, including as a machine learning engineer/researcher, data scientist, and actuary (FSA). These experiences have shaped my ability to adapt, innovate, and tackle complex challenges. I am eager to continue evolving, contributing, and making a meaningful impact in every opportunity I embrace.

My current technical interests lie in generative AI and machine learning, distributed systems, and product-focused backend development. I am passionate about building scalable, impactful solutions that bridge cutting-edge technologies with real-world applications. Beyond my professional pursuits, I’m an avid runner, tennis enthusiast, and ski lover.
