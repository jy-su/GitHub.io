I am Jingyi Su, currently a software engineer at [Google](https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/). 

>*“Careers are a jungle gym, not a ladder.”* ― Sheryl Sandberg ([book](https://leanin.org/book)). 

Over the past decade, I have honed my skills and grown through diverse technical and leadership roles ([linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jingyi-su)), including as a machine learning engineer/researcher, data scientist, and actuary ([FSA](https://www.soa.org/education/exam-req/edu-fsa-req/)). These experiences have shaped my ability to adapt, innovate, and tackle complex challenges. I am eager to continue evolving, contributing, and making a meaningful impact in every opportunity I embrace.

My current technical interests lie in generative AI and machine learning, distributed systems, and product-focused backend development. I am passionate about building scalable, impactful solutions that bridge cutting-edge technologies with real-world applications. Beyond my professional pursuits, I’m an avid runner, tennis enthusiast, and ski lover.
